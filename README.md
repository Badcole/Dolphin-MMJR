ANNOUNCEMENT:

=============================

I officially announce that I will be stopping any further development on |MMJR2| and leaving it in the hands of Lumince's version (To avoid confusion with the whole |MMJR2| new/old versions). So going forward if you still want to use |MMJR2|- please use Lumince version (https://github.com/Lumince/Dolphin-MMJR2/releases) as the defacto |MMJR2| going forward.

Both versions of |MMJR| are on github and I encourage determined or curious people to use the source code. However at the rate that Dolphin Official is going, down the line you might not need them anymore. However, if you still want something outside the official version then these forks are always freely available as an option.

So special thanks to @Lynx for his godly help and contributions, the testers and Gamer64ytb for further continuing work on MMJ/MMJR as both a tester and upcoming dev. Also many thanks to @Josjuice for the great updates, knowledge and development over at Dolphin Official (https://dolphin-emu.org/download/). Thanks to everyone for supporting the app and its development.
