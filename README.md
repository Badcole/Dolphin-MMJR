# Dolphin MMJR
An Android-only performance-focused Dolphin (Official) fork, continued from the Dolphin MMJ source code by Weihuoya. This version is merely to add or update the current MMJ code with further fixes and changes to hopefully improve things. However there is only so much that can be done with this so users please keep that in mind.

Grab the latest build in the [releases](https://github.com/Bankaimaster999/Dolphin-MMJR1/releases) section. The newer |MMJR2| builds can be found at the new repository [here](https://github.com/Bankaimaster999/Dolphin-MMJR2/releases). 1.0 and 2.0 builds can be installed without conflicts as they use different folders, but **savestates are not compatible**. We kindly ask you to avoid misusing GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

This fork wouldn't be possible without the crazy amount of work that developers much more skilled than us put into Dolphin.
